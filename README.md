# KMyMoney.Net

Libraries to work with .kmy files from KMyMoney from .NET, as well as a Telegram bot using these models to manipulate a .kmy file saved in DropBox.

AI disclosure: model classes are mostly (I'm sorry) AI-generated, other stuff originally was too, but later almost completely rewritten.
